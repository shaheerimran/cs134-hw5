CS 134 HW5 Part 3 (Other Enhancements)

Iâ€™ve made several enhancements to my portfolio to improve both functionality and user experience. First, I cleaned up the CSS for the navigation bar and headers across all pages, ensuring a consistent, modern look with improved spacing, hover effects, and responsiveness. To make the site more interactive and user-friendly, I added a floating chatbot that helps visitors navigate by answering common questions and providing quick links to different sections. These updates enhance the overall usability of the site while maintaining a clean and professional layout.
